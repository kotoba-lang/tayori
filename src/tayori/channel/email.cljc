(ns tayori.channel.email
  "Email Channel via the Gmail API (REST/HTTP) — matches local-manimani's
  existing Gmail integration (`server/src/gmail.ts`, `reply_llm` policy),
  generalized behind the Channel protocol so other tayori consumers
  (cloud-manimani, gijiroku) can reuse it without re-implementing Gmail auth.

  I/O is injected (`:http-fn` `:json-write` `:json-read` `:creds`), the same
  contract as `tayori.docport.git`/`kekkai.kotoba` — this ns stays dependency-
  free; a JVM host supplies a real `:http-fn` (e.g. `tayori.kotoba/jvm-http-fn`).

  `send-reply!` is called ONLY after human approval, by `tayori.operation`'s
  commit step — never by the reply-LLM advise path directly (no-actuation
  charter)."

  Gmail's `users.messages.send` wants a full base64url RFC 2822 `:raw`
  message (headers + MIME body); `:raw-fn` (thread body -> raw-string) does
  that encoding and is injected too — a JVM host can wire `jakarta.mail`,
  a cljs host a plain string-template + goog.crypt.base64. Not supplying
  `:raw-fn` is a configuration error, not a silent no-op: `send-reply!` throws
  rather than send a malformed message."
