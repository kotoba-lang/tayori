  "Channel port — the ONLY place a reply actually leaves the building. A
  reply-LLM proposal is data (a `:draft` record) until a human approves
  sending it; `send-reply!` is called exactly once, after that approval, by
  `tayori.operation`'s commit step. Real channels (`tayori.channel.email`
  `tayori.channel.slack` `tayori.channel.whatsapp`) implement this protocol
  with injected I/O (`:http-fn` `:json-write` `:json-read` `:creds`), same
  contract as kekkai/gijiroku's ports. `mock-channel` is the default — a
  deterministic in-memory channel so the actor is runnable and testable with
  no network/creds."
