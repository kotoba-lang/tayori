  "CorrespondenceActor — one draft/send or revise/publish operation = one
  supervised actor run, a langgraph-clj StateGraph. Two flows share one
  auditable graph:

    ingest (record-op):  intake → record → END
        a thread/message/contact/document becomes a durable ground fact.
        This is the observe charter; always on, never an LLM call, never an
        outbound send/publish.

    assess (assess-op):  intake → advise → govern → decide → commit|hold|approval
        reply-LLM (sealed) proposes a reply draft / document revision, or (for
        send/publish) a pass-through recommendation over an already-committed
        draft/revision; ComplianceGovernor enforces no-actuation / redaction /
        consent / tenant-isolation; the phase gate adds caution; sending a
        reply or publishing a document ALWAYS routes to a human
        (interrupt-before :request-approval).

  Single invariant (the tayori analog of robotaxi's safety contract / kekkai's
  no-data-plane-actuation):
    the actor never sends a message or publishes a document the
    ComplianceGovernor would reject, and reply-LLM never actuates directly —
    committing a draft/revision is data (a 'casual commit'); only a human
    approval turns it into an outbound send/publish (a 'PR merge')."
