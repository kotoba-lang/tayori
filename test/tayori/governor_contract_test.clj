  "The propose→draft/revise-only contract as executable tests — tayori's
  analog of kekkai's governor_contract_test / robotaxi's safety_contract_test.
  Invariant: the actor never sends a message or publishes a document the
  ComplianceGovernor would reject; drafting/revising never auto-actuates;
  sending/publishing always routes to a human regardless of phase."
